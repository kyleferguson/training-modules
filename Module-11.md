# Module 11: Docker

## Introduction
Docker containers are an integral part of the development and management of our DevOps workflow. After this module, you should be comfortable with most tasks required to interact and manage containers along with an understanding of their purpose and basic workings.

For this module, *create a new Git repo* for your Docker work in Module 11.

It is recommended that you read through each of the official documentation resources listed below and follow some of the links within each resource to help clarify specific tools and their purposes.

Resources and articles:
- [What is Docker?](https://www.docker.com/what-docker)
- [Official Dockerfile Reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/)
- [Official Docker Engine Docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/understanding-docker/)

## The Test

1. Install [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox/) on your local machine. Don't forget to run `/usr/local/bin/docker-machine env default` and `eval $(/usr/local/bin/docker-machine env default)` use the default environment.
2. Create a [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) account.
3. Login to your Docker Hub account using `docker login` in your terminal window.
4. Pull down the `alpine:3.3` image from Docker Hub.
5. Create a new file called _docker-module.txt_, and paste the output of `docker images` into the file.
6. Commit your changes and push up.
7. Run `sh` interactively inside of the `alpine:3.3` container using `docker run`. You should see a prompt showing `/ #`.
8. Using `apk` ([more info here](http://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_Linux_package_management)), install bash while inside of the container. You'll need add bash using the `--no-cache` flag.
9. Start a bash prompt inside of the container, and paste the current prompt into _docker-module.txt_.
10. Exit the container.
11. Commit your changes and push up.
12. Attempt to run `bash` inside of the container, and paste the output into _docker-module.txt_.

    > Since containers are immutable, they start in their original state everytime. Since the original 
    state of the container doesn't have `bash` installed, running the container again restarts the container without bash. This is one of the differences between the way containers and virtual 
    machines handle state.

13. Commit your changes and push up.
14. Create a new _Dockerfile_ that extends the `alpine:3.3` and installs `bash`.
15. Build a new image with the tag `realpage/alpine-bash:3.3` using your new _Dockerfile_.
16. Attempt to run bash inside of the new `realpage/alpine-bash:3.3` container, and paste the output into _docker-module.txt_.
17. Exit the container.
18. Commit your changes and push up.
19. Create a new executable file called _welcome.sh_ containing the following:
```
#!/bin/bash
echo 'Hello, World!'
```
20. Update the _Dockerfile_ so that _welcome.sh_ is added to `/home/welcome.sh` when the container is built.
21. Rebuild the container following the the changes.
22. Update the _Dockerfile_ so that _welcome.sh_ is run as the primary process within the container when the container is run.  Run the container with `docker run` and paste the output into _docker-module.txt_.
23. Commit your changes and push up.
24. Update the _Dockerfile_ so that it outputs "Hello, World!" when only running `docker run realpage/alpine-bash:3.3`.
25. Rebuild the container and run it via `docker run realpage/alpine-bash:3.3`.
26. Paste the output into _docker-module.txt_.
27. Commit your changes and push up.
28. Pull down the `dockercloud/hello-world` image. You can see the _Dockerfile_ for this image [here](docker pull dockercloud/hello-world).
29. Run the `dockercloud/hello-world` image without any arguments or flags.

    > The container continues to run and never exits. If you look at the _Dockerfile_, you can see that 
    `php-fpm` and `nginx` are running within the container. Since `nginx` is run with `-g "daemon off;"
    `, the process never exits and neither does the container!

30. Rerun `docker images` and paste the output into _docker-module.txt_.
31. Commit your changes and push up.

## Wrapping Up

When you are done, verify you have pushed your changes to GitHub. Please create a tag called v1.0 with a message of "ready for review" in your docker repo. Be sure your tags are pushed to the remote repository and are visible in GitHub.

Create an issue titled *Review Module 11 - Docker* and @mention your mentor and team leader.
